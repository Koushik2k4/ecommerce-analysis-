#  Business Insights – E-commerce Sales & Returns Analysis

This file contains summarized, business-level insights derived from the data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). Each section aligns with a key analysis block in the notebook.



### 1.  Product Category Performance

- **Electronics** generated the highest revenue overall, suggesting it’s the most valuable category per sale.
- **Clothing** and **Books** had the highest number of units sold, indicating high-volume but potentially low-margin products.
- A dual view of revenue and quantity helps balance inventory and promotional focus.



### 2.  Revenue by City

- Despite all cities placing the same number of orders, **Mumbai** and **Hyderabad** led in total revenue.
- This indicates higher-value orders from these cities, likely due to product mix or customer purchasing power.
- Businesses should prioritize premium offerings in these locations.



### 3.  Return Rate by Product Category

- **Clothing** and **Books** showed very high return rates (~60%), while other categories had none.
- This is likely due to common e-commerce issues: sizing problems (clothing) and shipment damage or incorrect delivery (books).
- Focused efforts on sizing guides and packaging improvements could reduce return losses.



### 4.  Customer Behavior

- Out of 20 customers, **0% placed more than one order**.
- While the dataset is small, it suggests **poor retention** or a business in its early stages.
- Strategies like email follow-ups, loyalty offers, and 2nd-order discounts can help build customer lifetime value.



### 5.  Monthly Sales Trend

- Revenue was strong in **January (₹4820)** and **March (₹4780)**, steady in **February**, and dropped sharply in **April (₹1210)**.
- This trend suggests a potential seasonal pattern, or inconsistency in marketing/stock during April.
- Early-month promotions or product launches could be explored to stabilize performance.
