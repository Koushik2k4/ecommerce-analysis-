# E-commerce Sales and Returns Analysis 

An end-to-end data analysis project using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) on a fictional e-commerce dataset.  
The goal was to extract actionable insights around sales performance, customer behavior, and product return patterns.

## Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Google Colab for notebook environment
- GitHub for version control and project showcase

## Project Objectives:
- Understand revenue distribution across product categories and cities
- Identify return hotspots and high-loss categories
- Analyze customer behavior, retention, and lifetime value potential
- Visualize sales trends over time to detect patterns or drops

## Key Business Insights:
- **Mumbai and Hyderabad** drive the highest revenue despite equal order volume across cities
- **Clothing and Books** show extremely high return rates , impacting profitability
- **Customer retention is 0%**, suggesting a lack of repeat engagement or early-stage business
- **April saw a major revenue dip** compared to January and March, indicating seasonal/marketing impact
